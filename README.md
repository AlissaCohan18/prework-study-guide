# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide captures notes to include : lessons learned, explanations of basic code, and shortcuts for beginner coders using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github, and VSCode.
The project is being built to serve as a reminder of good habbits to start forming and a quick reference guide until all of these items have been locked into memory.

## Usage

The prework study guide can be used to walk through creating new branches on Github, and later commiting the changes to github. It can also be used as reminders of shortcuts for several different applications (github, VSCode, terminal, and Chrome DevTools). It also captures some cheatsheet items for JavaScript and HTML. As I learn more, this will serve as a platform to continue to grow content useful for beginner developers.
